## HTML

### The importance of using semantic elements in HTML

Semantic HTML gives the content meaning. It can help to elevate to site's SEO ranking and it helps screen readers to read the content.

### Heading levels in HTML

There are six levels of heading in HTML from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.

### `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements

These tags surround superscript and subscript text, for example in maths, chemisty and for dates.

### The `<abbr>` element

This element indicates that the enclosed text is an abbreviateion. It should be given the title attribute to provide the expanded text on hover.

## CSS

### How to apply CSS to the HTML

There are three ways we can apply styling to our HTML document:

1. An external stylesheet. The HTML document needs to link to the css document via a `<link>` element in the document head.
2. An internal stylesheet. In this case the css is enclosed with opening and closing `<style>` tags in the document head.
3. Inline styling. This is applied directly into the target HTML element using the style attribute.

### Inline styles

Inline css overrides internal and external styling. However, we should avoid using them if possible because they make it harder to keep the documents maintained.
