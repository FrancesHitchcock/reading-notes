# Module 3 Class 11 Reading Notes

## Video and Audio Content

### Evolution of video and audio on the web since early 2000s

The original web video and audio required plug-ins such as **_flash_** and **_silverlight_**. The are now obsolete, and video and audio content are now handled using HTML `<video>` and `<audio>` elements, which are more secure and accessible.

### The use of `src` and `controls` attributes in the `<video>` element

The `src` attribute value is a link to the url of the source file - either locally or on the web. The `controls` attribute is a boolean attribute and defaults to true. It should always be included as it gives the user control over if, when and how they want to view the content.

### The importance of **fallback content** inside the `<video>` element

Some (older) browsers don't support video / audio content, so it's important to inform the user of this.

## Grid

### How the Grid layout differs from Flexbox

### Grid container, grid itema and grid line
