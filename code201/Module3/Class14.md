# Module 3 Class 14 Reading Notes

## CSS Transforms

### What CSS transforms allow the dev to do to an element

The transform property allows the dev to distort or change the positon of an element in 2D or 3D using the values:

- rotate
- scale
- translate
- skew

### An example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

A transform could be used along with an animation and an event listener to create an effect to interact with the user. For example a slide-in menu could be hidden off-screen using a transform and then brought into the screen with an animation.

## CSS Transitions and Animations

### What CSS transitions allow the dev to do to an element

Transitions control the appearance and behaviours of an element when a state change occurs (e.g. hover, active etc.), including:

- properties to change
- duration
- delay
- timing-function (the pattern of the change)

### How a CSS animation differs from a CSS Transition

An animation is different from a transition in that you can set breakpoints and produce more complicated effects.
