# Module 1 Class 2 Reading Notes

## HTML

### The importance of using semantic elements in HTML

Semantic HTML gives the content meaning. It can help to elevate to site's SEO ranking and it helps screen readers to read the content.

### Heading levels in HTML

There are six levels of heading in HTML from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.

### `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements

These tags surround superscript and subscript text, for example in maths, chemisty and for dates.

### The `<abbr>` element

This element indicates that the enclosed text is an abbreviation. It should be given the title attribute to provide the expanded text on hover.

## CSS

### How to apply CSS to the HTML

There are three ways we can apply styling to our HTML document:

1. An external stylesheet. The HTML document needs to link to the css document via a `<link>` element in the document head.
2. An internal stylesheet. In this case the css is enclosed with opening and closing `<style>` tags in the document head.
3. Inline styling. This is applied directly into the target HTML element using the style attribute.

### Inline styles

Inline css overrides internal and external styling. However, we should avoid using them if possible because they make it harder to keep the documents maintained.

### CSS structure

In the above code the selector is the h2 element; The declaration is all the rule sets contained within the curly braces; color and padding are properties.

## JavaScript Basics

### Strings

A sequence of text enclosed in single or double quotes is a string datatype. It can also be enclosed in backticks.

### JavaScript operators

For examples of operators are:

1. `+` add
2. `-` subtract
3. `*` multiply
4. `/` divide

### Problem solving with functions

You could use a function to determine the area of a rectangle by passing arguments for length and width.

## JavaScript Conditionals

### if statements

An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true then the code block will execute.

### else if statements

An else if statement runs if the condition in the preceding if or else if statement evaluates to false.

### Comparison operators

Three examples of comparison operators are:

1. `===` strict equals
2. `!==` strict does not equal
3. `<=` less than or equal to

### Logical operators

The `&&` operator means 'and'. In this case both (or more) conditions must be satisfied for the code block to execute.
The `||` operator means 'or'. Either one (or more) of the conditions must be satisfied for the the code to execute.
