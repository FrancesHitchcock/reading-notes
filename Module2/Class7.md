## Domain Modelling

### Why we need domain modelling

Accreditation: [Codefellows](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

Domain modelling creates a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. It can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem. It also defines the vocabulary of the model's communication system.

An object-oriented programming language defines data in properties and behaviours in methods.

## HTML Table basics

### Why tables should not be used for page layouts

- Tables are rigid structures that hinder responsiveness
- The table tag system is quite complicated, and so it's harder to update and maintain
- It can be hard to make sense of them when using a screen reader

### Three examples of sementic HTML elements used in a `<table>`

- `<tr>` - table row
- `<th>` - table header
- `<td>` - table data

## Constructors

### Constructors and their advantages

A constructor is a function that creates objects. This is useful if you want to create lots of different objects with the same or similar properties and methods.

### `this` in an object literal vs `this` in a constructor

In an object literal the `this` keyword refers to the object itself when referring to that property withing a method. In a constructor the properties and the methods are initiated using the `this` keyword.
