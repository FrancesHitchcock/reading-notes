## nosql vs sql

### 5 Differences between nosql and sql

- SQL databases are primarily relational databases, whereas NoSQL databases are non-relational or distributed.
- SQL is table-based. NoSQL is a collection of key-value pairs, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores.
- SQL has pre-defined schema. NoSQL has dynamic schema.
- SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) to define and manipulate data. NoSQL uses Unstructured Query Language, and its syntax varies depending on the database.
- SQL databases are vertically scalable, and increased load can be managed on a single server. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable and increase load can be handled by adding servers.

Data with hierarchical data storage and a large data set.

### Give a real world example.
