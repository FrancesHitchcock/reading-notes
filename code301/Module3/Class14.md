# Module 3 Class 14 Reading Notes

## Diversity and Inclusion

### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

When personal computers started showing up in homes in the US - and were used predominantly for games - the perception grew that computers were for men and boys.

### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

It was assumed by Computer Science professors that their students had grown up playing on computers. This made the women students less likely to achieve at first, which made them more likely to drop out of their courses.

### When are diversity efforts most successful?

When they are driven by commitment from company leaders.

### Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diverse groups of people have diverse minds and experiences. They bring different ways of seeing a problem, which maximises creativity.

### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

When YouTube's company first built their app, left-handed users had problems downloading videos. This could have been avoided if left-handed people had been involved in the production.
