### Psychological Safety and how it impacted previous work experience

"Psychologically safe workplaces promote healthier, more productive and more inclusive workforces. They also provide the environment in which innovation can thrive and people can perform at their best."

I would add to this that it also promotes a safer work environment. When working in an industrial environment where safety was paramount, a culture of challenge was promoted. People throughout the organisation were regularly reminded and trained that they should feel comfortable challenging people whatever their position in the company, and people were also trained to be able to listen to challenges without prejudice. It was hard to change a culture however.

### How the article will inform my approach to working with others

I will do my best to ensure everyone I work with feels included and able to speak out. I will do the same myself and not take criticism personally.
